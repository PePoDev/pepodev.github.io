# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that allows you to build fast, content-focused websites with less JavaScript. In this post, we'll explore why Astro is gaining popularity and how to get started.

## What Makes Astro Special?

Astro stands out from other frameworks with its unique approach:

- **Zero JS by Default**: Astro ships zero JavaScript to the browser by default, making your sites blazingly fast
- **Component Islands**: Use interactive components only where needed with "Islands Architecture"
- **Framework Agnostic**: Bring your own UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte, or none!)
- **Built for Content**: Perfect for blogs, documentation, and marketing sites

## Key Features

### 1. Content Collections

Astro's Content Collections provide a type-safe way to manage your markdown content:

```typescript
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const blog = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
  }),
});
```

### 2. File-based Routing

Creating pages is as simple as adding files to your `src/pages/` directory. No complex routing configuration needed!

### 3. Optimized Performance

Astro automatically optimizes your images, bundles your CSS, and generates static HTML for incredible performance.

## Getting Started

Install Astro with a single command:

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts, and you'll have a new Astro project up and running in seconds!

## Conclusion

Astro is perfect for building content-rich websites that need to be fast and SEO-friendly. Whether you're building a blog, documentation site, or marketing pages, Astro provides the tools you need to succeed.
